# Geotools
A simple application that enables for some quick drawing of shapes, to copy in different output formats as well as different SRID's.

In the course of the last 5 years, I've needed to draw and create a number of shapes for testing. I've also needed to
convert from one format to another. I've had to use many differnet tools, to finally get a single shape i was interested in.
This tool is designed for my specific pain points, and maybe it'll help you too in the future.
